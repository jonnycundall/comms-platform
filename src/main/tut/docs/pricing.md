#Pricing structure

The cost of comms in the platform is currently pretty low so there is not a billing structure in place at the moment. 

For future reference the cost of comms is:

| Comm                 | Cost    | Supplier |
|----------------------|---------|----------|
| Email                | $0.0005 | Mailgun  |
| SMS                  | $0.04   | Twilo    |
| Letter (1 sheet)     | 47p     | Stannp   |
| Letter (extra sheet) | 5p      |          |
