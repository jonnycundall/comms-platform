# SMS

An SMS template consists of a single template file:

* `body.txt` is a Handlebars template for the text of the message

The alphanumeric sender of the SMS as it appears to the recipient of the message is dependant on the brand associated with the template when you upload it (more about templates [here](../templates.html)). The senders for each brand currently appear as follows:

|Brand  | SMS Sender ID|
|-------|--------------|
|OVO    | OVO Energy   |
|----------------------|
|Boost  | Boost Power  |
|----------------------|
|Corgi  | Corgi  	   |
|----------------------|
|VNet   | VNet         |
|----------------------|
|Lumo   | Lumo Energy  |
|----------------------|
