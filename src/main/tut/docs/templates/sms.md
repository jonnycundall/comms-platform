# SMS

An SMS template consists of a single template file:

* `body.txt` is a Handlebars template for the text of the message

The sender of the SMS currently always appears to the recipient as "OVO Energy". In the future this will be dependant on the brand associated with the template, if you're interested to hear more about the progress of this feel free to speak to the team on our slack channel #hello_comms.
